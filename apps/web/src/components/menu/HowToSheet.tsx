          It is <span className="text-white">1 ÷ chance</span>, less a 4% fee. The chance
          comes from a distribution measured on real market tape for each round length —
          not a curve we assumed. Over a three-second round the price often does not move
          at all, and pricing that off a bell curve would be wrong in the house&apos;s
          favour.

          <span className="text-white">The 4% fee is not the whole spread.</span> Volatility
          moves faster than any fixed calibration, so the chance quoted is not the middle of
          what the market has recently done — it is the high end of it, taken across many
          recent windows. Quoting a chance at or above the real one is what keeps the vault
          solvent when the regime changes, and it costs real money: replayed across four
          separate stretches of held-out tape the effective edge ran from about 3% to about
          42%, depending far more on how volatile that stretch happened to be than on the
          round length. It is always in the house&apos;s favour. It is also why no win
          percentage is printed on the deck — the model&apos;s number is a pricing input,
          not a forecast.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-[13px] leading-relaxed text-white/55">
          The keeper re-marks volatility on-chain as it moves, which narrows that spread
          toward the fee.
